NAMESPACE
  A container for variables and functions.
  JavaScript doesn't have namespace but we can fake it.

  USING OBJECTS AS CONTAINERS to prevent name clashes.

  var greet = 'Hello!';
  var greet = 'Hola';

  console.log(greet);

  var english = {};
  var spanish = {};

  // It is important that I create an object before storing
  // anything in it.
  english.greetings = {};
  english.greetings.greet = "Hello!";
  spanish.greet = "Hola!";
