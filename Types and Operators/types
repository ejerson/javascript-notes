DYNAMIC TYPING
  var varB = "Yes";
  Variables can hold different types of data because
  its all figured out during execution, I don't need
  to tell javascript the type of data I want to save
  in a variable.

  NO NEED TO FREAKING WORY ABOUT CASTING

STATIC TYPING
  int varA = 1;


PRIMITIVE TYPES a data that represents a single value
  undefined (don't use directly, let the engine deal with it)
  null (use to indicate that something doesn't exist)
  boolean (true false)
  number (floating point number, decimal)
  string
  symbol (used in ES6)
