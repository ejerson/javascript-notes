Boolean(undefined); // false
Boolean(null); // false
Boolean(""); // false



var a;

if (a) {
  console.log("Something is in a");
}

We can take advantage of coercion to check if a variable has
a value. BUT if a = 0, this also evaluates to false, which is
a problem.

To work around this do the following:

if (a || a === 0) {
  console.log("Something is in a");
}

=== will be evaluated first which will equal to true,
then 'a' will be coerced which will result in a false.
