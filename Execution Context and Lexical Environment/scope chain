SCOPE CHAIN
  if a variable is accessed inside a function
  that is not declare inside that function, it will
  use the variable residing inside the global
  execution context's  variable environment.

EVERY EXECUTION CONTEXT HAS A REFERENCE TO
ITS OUTER ENVIRONMENT. So, the execution context
of a function, if it is directly
inside the global execution context,
will have access to the global execution context.

LET
  using this keyword instead of var allows for
  block scoping which prevents an outer environment
  from having access to the variable environment of
  a function.
