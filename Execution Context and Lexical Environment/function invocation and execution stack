1. Global Execution Context is Created
    memory for functions are allocated
2. When a function is called, an execution stack is created
    Whichever one is on top is the one that is currently running

    bFuncInsideA();
    aFunc();
    Global Execution Context

3. Every time a function is invoked in javascript, a new execution
    context is created and placed in the execution stack.
    When a function finishes its execution context is popped from
    the execution stack.
