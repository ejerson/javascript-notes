FUNCTIONS ARE OBJECTS
  FIRST CLASS FUNCTIONS: Everything you can do with other types
  (object, strings, numbers) you can do with functions.
  You can assign functions to variables, pass them around,
  create them on the fly.

  Functions are a special type of object. Doesn't have to have a name.
  The code (invocable) that I write inside a function is just another
  property that I'm adding on. A function can contain the following:
    Primitive
    Object
    Function
    NAME
    CODE

    function greet() {

    }

**** I can add properties to functions
    greet.language = 'english';
